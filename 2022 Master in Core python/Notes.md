# **Master in Core Python Programming** 

## Day 1: Python as a language
> Python job market 
- Python different fields: AI, Data science, Data analytics, Machine learning, Web development, Imaging processing or face recognition, Video processing, game development. 
- Companies that used python: Google, Youtube, Intel, IBM, NASA, Pixar, Netflix, Facebook, Spotify, Reddit, Pinterest, Instagram, JP Morgan. 

## Day 2: Python downloading and installation
> Install python into the computer
- Difference between Python 2 and Python 3: Python 3 release in 2008, 6 years later. 
- Python 2: print "hello world"; Python 3: print("Hello World")
- Python 2: int a = 5/2 -> 2; Python 3: int a = 5/2 --> 2.5
- Python 2: raw_input(); Python 3: input()
- python 2: xrange: generate any number in the range; Python 3: use range
- Python 2: ASCI is used to store string; Python 3: UNIVODE is used to store string
- Python 2: Integer size up to 32 bit; Python 3: Unlimited
- How to check if Python is installed: Type "python" in cmd, will pop information related to python. 

## Day 3: Hello World Program
> IDE, Hellow world program
- IDE: Integrated Development Environment. 
- Hello world in cmd: print "hello world" (Python 2 installed)
- Hello world in plain text: open notepad, write print "hello world" in the file and save as hello_world.py, execute use python hello_world.py
- Hello world in Notepad ++: open notepad++, write print "hellow world" in the file and save as test.py, execute python test.py
- Hello world in VS code: create new file in vs code, name as hello_world.py. Write the same line inside and run the code inside vs code. 

## Day 4: Input and output in python
> Learning input and output function
- input(): get anything from user. Can put string inside the () to give direction to user. String will apear in the command. 
- Output: display anything to user, print(). 

## Day 5: Important concepts in python
> Python 2/3 difference, Comments, statement, Terminator, Indentation
- Python 2/3 difference: print difference; int difference; raw_input and input(); xrange and range; 
- In python 2, 5/2 ->2; In python 3, 5/2 ->2.5. 
- comments in python: Single line comment (#); Multiple line comment ("""aaa""""); 
- Program: a set of instruction that provided to computer;
- Statement: a complete action in the program; Separate the statement using semicolon ';' on single line
- Separator in python: semicolon. No need for separator in python, but in C++, need separator. 
- Indentation: need proper space to keep code in specific block. 

## Day 6: Variables in python
> What is a variable? 
- Variable can change during program execution; 
- Variable is the identifier, you need to declare and initiate. 
> Decalaration and initialization of variable in python
- Decalaration: write name of variable without providing a value. 
- Initialization: after declaration, we need to provide a value to declared variable. In python, no need for decalaration; In C++, need decalaration. 
> What is expression? 
- Expression: collection of operator and operand. 
- Operator: symbol that perform an operation, like +, - ...
- Operand: things which operation is performed 
> Undefined variable in python
- Variable that you did not declare or initialized. 
> Types of variables
- Global: Variable that is declared outside of any specific block of code; 
- local: Variable that is declared inside a specific block of code.
